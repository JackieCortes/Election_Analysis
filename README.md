# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee, Tom, has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determina the winner of the election based on popular vote.

This task usually is done en Excel, but his manager wanted to know if it is possible to autommate the task. If it is an alternative the option will be used for other elections.
The task was done as it was planned and the result was delivered in the txt file requested.

 ## Challenge Overview
 Analyzing the information with Python is faster than using Excel in performance terms. It takes less than 3 seconds. Also, any issue regarding the amount of data was avoided due to the easy way to consult the information.
 
 Even though the code was difficult to understand at the beginning for the new way to think about cycles in dictionaries, at the end, looking at the results, we can see how powerful it is.
 
 Talking about the required results, the show three candidates and the winner overtook for more than 50% of the other candidates. Undeniably Diana DeGette was the winner.
